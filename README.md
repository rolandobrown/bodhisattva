This will be a basic open source Rails App that:

- **a**. includes some of the basic methods of that artfully models the capacities of anyone "who, motivated by great compassion, has generated bodhicitta, which is a spontaneous wish to attain Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings."

- **b**. makes it easy for programmers and engineers to contribute to the advancement of this code base.

- **c**. makes it easy for peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers, singers, musicians and lovers of all kind to contribute to the advancement of the art, mantras, songs, practices, etc. that may come from making and sharing this project.

General goals for building these types of digital art projects:

- **x**. The very specific and collaborative building of apps and songs that go together.

- **y**. The making of apps that are specific to how one experiences and contributes to a song.

- **z**. The encouraging of people who “write code” and those who “right hearts” to work together.
